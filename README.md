# Jinglefy

### A GrubHub clone made by [Ellie Starr].

#### Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for Restaurants, Items, and Reviews, with a Cart feature coming soon.
This is a fullstack application developed as part of App Academy's 24 week software engineering bootcamp. I chose Grubhub as my site to clone because not only am I a frequent user of the service, but my sister actually works for the company. I also wanted to incorporate something with an ecommerce type of feeling for my portfolio, as my previous projects haven't had anything like it. During the development process I learned lots of useful things, such as how to use Modals more dynamically, and several CSS tricks to make my site feel satisfying to use.
